# K8s Automation Script

## ðŸ“Œ Notes on Helm Installation
- This script uses **Helm v3**, which is a client-only tool. There is **no need to install Helm components inside the Kubernetes cluster itself.**
- Helm is installed **on the local system**, and it uses your `kubectl` configuration to communicate with the cluster.
- the assignment says "install Helm within the cluster," which seems unnecessary.
- You can find the screenshots from the sample run in the screenshots' folder.
